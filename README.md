## �️ Installation
REMEMBER: ChatGPT or Google Gemini is your friend if you get an error installing just copy and paste the error and ask what is wrong. Heck you can always upload the `vivid.py` file to your favourite chatbot to get help.

For quick installation guides for Windows or Linux / macOS please go to the [Vivid Chat App](https://www.youtube.com/@VividChatApp) YouTube channel.

### 🎥 OS-Specific Installation Guides
- [▶️ Windows Installation Guide](https://www.youtube.com/@VividChatApp)
- [▶️ Linux / macOS Installation Guide](https://www.youtube.com/@VividChatApp)

### 1. Clone the Repository or download the zip (below)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vividchatapp/vivid
cd vivid
```
### (for non developer types or Windows systems) download the zip
![App Screenshot](assets/downloadzip.jpg)
---
extract the zip 

![APp SCreenshot](assets/extractzip.jpg)

it will unzip to a folder called `vivid-main`

![APp SCreenshot](assets/extractwindow.jpg)

Rename the folder from `vivid-main` to `vivid`. Usually right click on the folder `vivid-main` choose rename (this is not mandtory just recommended)
```bash
rename vivid-main vivid
```
### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

#### Windows
```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Linux / macOS
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### 3. Install Dependencies
> **Note:** Once the virtual environment is activated, your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Linux/macOS) should be prefixed with `(venv)`. This indicates that you are working within the isolated virtual environment. See Section 5 for visual examples of how the prompt should look.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

### 4. Configuration
Copy the sample environment file to env.json and edit it as follows:

   **Windows**
   ```powershell
   copy env.json.sample env.json
   notepad env.json
   ```
   **Linux / macOS**
   ```bash
   cp env.json.sample env.json
   nano env.json
   ```
Update the env.json file with the following information:
  - `TELEGRAM_USER_ID`: Your numeric Telegram User ID (get this from `@userinfobot`).
   - `BOT_PREFIX`: The default bot identifier (must match a key in `TELEGRAM_TOKENS` this can be anything you want, default 'vivid1').
   - `TELEGRAM_TOKENS`: A map of prefixes to bot tokens (get tokens from `@BotFather` using  `/newbot` or `/mybots` command).
   - `OLLAMA_ONLINE`: API keys and descriptions for hosted Ollama-compatible services keys can be found at [https://ollama.com/settings/keys](https://ollama.com/settings/keys) choose `Add API key` button when it is generated paste it to the `api_key` field. You can have multiple keys but that would require multiple accounts. This is handy because Ollama online has usage limits, but since your chat data is stored on your local computer you can just select a different account to continue.
   - `OLLAMA_LOCAL`: IP/host URLs for instances running on a local computer.
---

### 5. Run/Restart vivid.py
Note you must be in the virtual environment `venv`, in order to run vivid.py you should see something like `(venv)` prefixing your command prompt:

Examples
#### linux / macOS
```
(venv) user@raspberrypi:~/vivid $
```
#### windows
```
(venv) PS C:\Dev\vivid>  
```

If you don't see the `(venv)` prefix, you can activate the virtual environment by typing the commands below to activate it:
#### Windows
```powershell dos
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Linux / macOS
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
to run vivid

```bash
python vivid.py
```

or you can run these wrapper commands that start venv automatically (easier to do this)

#### Windows
```powershell dos
vwin.bat
```

For linux / macOS make sure you make `run_vivid.sh` executable by typing:
```bash
chmod +x vlin.sh
```
this only has to be done once. If you do not do this you probably get the error
`-bash: ./run_vivid.sh: Permission denied`
or something similar


#### Linux / macOS
```bash
./vlin.sh
```

## 💾 Session & Context Management

Vivid Chat automatically preserves conversations—even if vivid.py crashes.

- Active chat is continuously saved in the `chats/` folder
- Session file format:
  `[vivid_PREFIX]_last_session.json`

### Crash Recovery or Vivid Restart
If vivid.py crashes or you restart vivid.py, vivid.py will load your last session automatically.

So vivid.py will remember the provider, model, role, character(s), scene(s) and the whole conversation history (context).
These are all kept inside the session json.
`[vivid_PREFIX]_last_session.json`

## ▶️ How to Run (Ollama Online Setup)

Vivid Chat works with **Ollama online models**, which require an API key.
This is how I would run it.

## Online Model to Use
**gemma4:31b (58.25 GB)** this gives me the best NSFW roleplay storytelling experience
if it refuses just `.resend`


### 1. Create an Ollama Account

Go to:\
https://ollama.com

Sign up if you don't already have an account.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Generate an API Key

1.  Click your profile icon (top-right corner)\
2.  Open **Settings**\
3.  Go to **Keys**\
4.  Click **Generate API Key**\
5.  (Optional) Give it a name\
6.  Click **Create**\
7.  Copy the API key and save it somewhere safe (e.g., Notepad)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Add API Key to `env.json`

Paste your API key into the `OLLAMA_ONLINE` section:

``` json
"OLLAMA_ONLINE": [
  {
    "api_key": "PUT_YOUR_KEY_HERE",
    "description": "Ollama 1"
  },
  {
    "api_key": "PUT_YOUR_KEY_HERE",
    "description": "Ollama 2"
  }
]
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 💡 Using Multiple Accounts (Recommended)

Ollama free accounts have usage limits.

To work around this:

-   Create **2 accounts** (for example, using two Gmail addresses)\
-   Generate an API key for each account\
-   Add vividh keys to `env.json`

This allows you to:

-   Switch between accounts when limits are reached\
-   Continue conversations seamlessly (context is stored locally in
    `vivid.py`)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 🧠 Notes

-   Context is managed locally, so switching accounts does **not** reset
    your conversation\
-   You don't need a powerful machine --- vivid mainly acts as a controller

Example setup:

-   Running on a **Raspberry Pi Zero W** this is what I am doing it works fine
-   Multiple vivid instances connected to Telegram

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ✅ Summary

-   Create Ollama account(s)\
-   Generate API key(s)\
-   Add them to `env.json`\
-   Run vivid.py\
-   Switch accounts if limits are reached

### Running locally 
Honestly if you're just intested in NSFW chatting use the online, if not install Ollama and do an `ollama pull [modelname]` I find Gemma 4 models are really good for NSFW roleplay / chatting.
